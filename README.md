This is BattleShip using HTML CSS and JavaScript

The game is player vs cpu where the user will place all their ships on the board then make guesses to try and sink the CPU ships and the cpu will attempt to sink all of your ships.

The game boards will be built dynamically and be re-rendered to the screen depending on who's turn it is - CPU / PLAYER
  This will allow the user to see their own board while the CPU takes a guess and see the outcome so they can track how well the CPU is doing and then allow them to see the CPUs board to make their own guess and continue to track their progress.
